# Wardrobe Recommendation System

An intelligent fashion recommendation system that provides personalized outfit suggestions using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

# Project Overview

This system bridges the gap between static image recognition and dynamic style advice. 
It leverages Computer Vision and NLP to recommend complete outfits based on:

- User wardrobe inventory
- Weather conditions
- Occasion & context
- Style preferences

# Technologies Used

- BERT (NLP)
- ResNet / YOLO (Computer Vision)
- Siamese Networks (Outfit Compatibility)
- Graph Databases (Style relationships)

# System Workflow

1. User uploads wardrobe images or text query.
2. Feature extraction using ML models.
3. Semantic style graph traversal.
4. Outfit compatibility scoring.
5. Personalized recommendation output.

# Objectives

- Improve outfit compatibility accuracy.
- Integrate contextual factors (weather, event, time).
- Promote sustainable fashion by using existing wardrobe.

# Future Scope

- Virtual Try-On with AR
- Real-time trend integration
- Generative AI for custom fashion designs

Developed as part of academic project submission.
